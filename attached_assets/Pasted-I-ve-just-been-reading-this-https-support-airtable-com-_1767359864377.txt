I've just been reading this: https://support.airtable.com/docs/managing-api-call-limits-in-airtable

I'm on the Teams plan at the moment, so I'm limited to 100,000 API calls a month. Should we be concerned at all, about approaching this limit, or what might happen if we send more than 5 requests per second or anything like that?

I integrated my gmail account as you requested, and you went and set that up, which means it will likely work nicely here in the Preview pane, but I'm only one of the users. What's going to happen when any of the other users try to send email like this, not from within the Replit preview but from the actual site (integrity-prod.fly.dev) once I push everything to GitHub and then to Fly? What else do I need to do to make it work, if anything? If there's anything to do, I'm going to need to probably get Gemini to step me through it. If so, please write me a prompt that I can give to Gemini so that it knows what the problem is and is able to deliver me a step-by-step solution, treating me like I know basically nothing about this.


Regarding the email signature, here is the EXACT HTML that we had previously decided worked perfectly for one of our team, designed to be pasted to Mercury. Can you please go through that and make sure that all signatures everywhere specifically follow this format and style without any variation whatsoever?

In the Quill WYSIWYG editor, when I typed some text and then clicked the button to make it a link, the dialog that came up was at least partly too far out to the left to be visible, so I'm not really sure how it works. Can you please put it in a better place?

In the signature generator, the modal is just too small - please make it bigger overall. When I click Generate, I can only see a ridiculously thin field to display the signature (which means I therefore can't see any of it).
